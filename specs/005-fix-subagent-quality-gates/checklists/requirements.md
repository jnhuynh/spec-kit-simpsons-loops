# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Subagent Delegation and Quality Gate Consolidation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec references specific file paths (`.specify/quality-gates.sh`, `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/commands/*.md`) as these are key entities in the feature domain, not implementation details.
- The spec mentions "Agent tool" and `claude --agent` as these are the user-facing product features being fixed, not implementation choices.
